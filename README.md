## Detailed Description 

### Linux Commands

- [LS_Command()](https://github.com/Satvik2910/Training_Task/blob/Task/LS_Command.java)
- [Wc_Command()](https://github.com/Satvik2910/Training_Task/blob/Task/WC_COMMAND.java)
- [PIPE_Command()](https://github.com/Satvik2910/Training_Task/blob/Task/PIPE_Command.java)


####  LS_Command()
For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names of
     files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
     information.

If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are
     displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately
     and in lexicographical order.

####  Wc_Command()
The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in
     each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the
     standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by
     a ⟨newline⟩ character.  Characters beyond the final ⟨newline⟩ character
     will not be included in the line count.

A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
     characters.  White space characters are the set of characters for which the
     iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is
     specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on a
     separate line after the output for the last file.

####  PIPE_Command()
The pipe(|) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue manager to
       deliver messages to external commands.  This program expects to be run
       from the master(|) process manager.

Message attributes such as sender address, recipient address and next-hop
       host name can be specified as command-line macros that are expanded
       before the external command is executed.

## FAQ

#### Why should we use Linux?

The Linux operating system is very stable, reliable, and less prone to crashes than other operating systems. 

#### What are advantages of using Linux?


- As it is open-source, its source code is easily available. ...
- The Linux security feature is the main reason that it is the most favorable option for developers.
- Lightweight. 
- Stability. 
- Performance.

## Appendix

### What is Linux?

Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

### What's a command line?

The command line is your direct access to a computer. It's where you ask software to perform hardware actions that point-and-click graphical user interfaces (GUIs) simply can't ask. 

Command lines are available on many operating systems—proprietary or open source. But it’s usually associated with Linux, because both command lines and open source software, together, give users unrestricted access to their computer.
